= Chain Evolution
Peter Lawrey

This highlights the stages to go through to create a new chain.

=== Create an address

To create an address, you need to

- generate a random private 32-byte key. The more randomly sourced the better. Keep this secure
- compute a secret/public key from the private key.

Request to create a new address from the main chain with `CreateAddressRequest` which will produce a `CreateAddressEvent` if successful.
In the genesis block there will be `CreateAddressEvent`s without requests to create them.

=== Running a node

In order to run a node, you need an address which has a verified IP and matches the last 6 bytes of the public key. i.e. the last 6 bytes are the port and IP address in little endian.

If you do not, you need to delegate authority to nodes which have verified IP addresses to run the chain.

=== Running multiple nodes

The primary address can delegate authority to multiple nodes.
The number of nodes running as servers determines how many are require to
 achieve a majority (50%+1) or super majority (2/3rd + 1)

=== Setting a fee structure

The primary address can determine the fee structure and initial state of the chain.

The initial

    - token types
    - amounts for addresses
    - fair exchange rates for settlement purposes

Rewards for running a node

    - per transaction
    - per round, including "winning" rounds

The cost for individual transactions, including

    - transfer
    - exchange
    - creating tokens

NOTE: The rewards and the fees don't have to match
which can lead to inflationary or deflationary pressure.

=== Securing the chain

At any time an address can invalidate itself preventing it being used in future.

If it hasn't delegated authority, this will prevent any further action for the address or the chain.

However, if authority has been delegated, a majority of addresses deleted to, can act on the addresses behalf.
These addresses in turn, can change the list of delegates allowing nodes to join and leave a cluster over time.

Such delegation ensures that one address or node being compromised doesn't give access tot he account.

=== Batches of approved transactions

Delegates to act on an addresses behalf,
a batch of the same transaction signed
by a majority of delegates must submitted as a batch.

This isn't required if only one delegate exists.

== Inter chain transfers

To pass money from one chain to another,
the transaction has to be confirmed by the chain which created the token.

Initially, all tokens will be on the first "main" chain,
however over time chains might pass tokens to each other via a third chain.
